# BatteryHealthTracker

🚀 Battery Performance Monitoring & Analysis

This Python script connects to an SQL database to retrieve battery voltage trends from IoT devices, calculates average battery drop per day, and visualizes battery deterioration over time.

🔧 Features:
✅ SQL Integration – Fetches battery voltage data using PyODBC.
✅ Data Processing – Uses Pandas for cleaning & trend analysis.
✅ Visualization – Plots battery health over time with Matplotlib.
✅ Performance Tracking – Computes average battery degradation per day.

📂 Technologies Used:
Python 🐍
PyODBC (Database Connection)
Pandas (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
SQL Server (Database Backend)
